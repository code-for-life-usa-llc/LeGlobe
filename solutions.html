        <h2>how do we know these things will work?</h2>
        <p>how we will know is if people start to do the list above then people will see a change in their health and their bills becoming less expensive to where they can afford to pay it every day, people being careful of where they throw trash and more solar pannels which means more energy without no fossil fuels!!:D but some people will disagree with this idea because some solar panels use fossil fuels to get energy from the sun but the expensive ones dont, tazing people would lead to death or just injuries, people need to drive to get to work or anywhere else, some people will not listen and make things worse and people will just waste money because they need supplies to survive or just waste their stuff on useless things. </p>

        <p>Even if some of these ideas are bad, people are trying to clean the planet so that we can live for more than 10000 years:> people still care about this planet because this planet helps us live:></p>
