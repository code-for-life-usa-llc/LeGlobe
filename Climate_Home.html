         <h1 class="p">What is Climate Change?</h1>
         <p class="p"> -Climate change is a very severe case that is affecting many parts of the world but mostly to Antartica. Climate Change mostly refers to a long-term change in the average 
            <br>weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local,regional and global climates. This can and will be lethal to our planet since many living things such as humans 
            <br> can't survive the very hot temperatures.Climate change has a range of lesser-known impacts, including ocean acidification, exacerbation of social and economic inequalities,
            <br>changes in precipitation patterns affecting agriculture and water resources, release of methane from thawing permafrost, and impacts on human health. This critical issue 
            <br> is primarily driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, leading to rising temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather. Addressing this
            <br> challenge requires global action to reduce emissions and transition to sustainable energy sources.</p>

            <h2 class="p">Why is Climate change important?</h2>
            <p class="p">-Climate change is important because it has significant and far-reaching impacts on the environment, human health, economies, and societies. It affects natural ecosystems, 
            <br>contributes to extreme weather events, and poses risks to food and water supplies. Addressing climate change is crucial for ensuring a sustainable and habitable planet 
            <br> for current and future generations. In addition to the dangers mentioned earlier, climate change can also lead to rising sea levels, which threaten coastal communities and 
            <br>ecosystems. It can disrupt agriculture, trade, and industry, leading to economic instability and affecting livelihoods worldwide. Addressing climate change requires global 
            <br> efforts to transition to renewable energy sources and build resilience in the face of ongoing changes. Climate change is important because it has significant and far-reaching 
            <br>impacts on the environment, human health, economies, and societies. It affects natural ecosystems, contributes to extreme weather events, and poses risks to food and water
